# HandBrake TSD Helper

A clean, self-hosted web dashboard for managing HandBrake encodes across a movie and TV library.

HandBrake TSD Helper is built for Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, NAS, and homelab users who want to reduce media file sizes without giving up control over quality, audio, subtitles, presets, hardware encoding, or file safety.

Completed output files are tagged with `-TSD`, short for "Transcoded", so the app can skip media that has already been processed.

## V3 Beta

V3 Beta is a full interface overhaul built around a cinema-operations workspace. It adds a persistent desktop sidebar, a phone-friendly bottom dock, a global command center (`Ctrl/Cmd+K` or `/`), faster Library search and queue actions, clearer Smart Preset surfaces, and a visible Source → Intent → Preview → Queue workflow in Size Wizard. The poster framework and encoding engine are unchanged.

V2 Classic remains available while V3 is in beta. Open **Settings > Interface**, select **V2 Classic**, and save. For an immediate one-page fallback, add `?ui=v2` to any ByteSqueeze URL. The saved V3/V2 choice and comfortable/compact density are independent of encoding settings.

The beta Docker tags are intentionally separate from `main` and `latest`:

```bash
docker pull kevina1724/handbrake-tsd-helper:beta
docker pull kevina1724/handbrake-tsd-worker:beta
```

For Compose, layer the included beta override over the normal file so all mounts, devices, and environment settings stay the same:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.beta.yml pull hb-web
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.beta.yml up -d hb-web

docker compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml -f docker-compose.worker.beta.yml pull bytesqueeze-worker
docker compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml -f docker-compose.worker.beta.yml up -d bytesqueeze-worker
```

## Release 3.12 Autopilot Refresh

The 3.12 experience is designed for set-it-up-and-let-it-run operation without making users hunt through Settings or giving automation unlimited control:

- **Observe mode** scans and explains what it would queue without changing the queue.
- **Manage mode** queues only stable, allowed media within the configured schedule, batch limit, and maximum active-job count.
- **Readiness checks** call out missing library mappings, presets, durable storage, hardware acceleration, and worker availability.
- **Dedicated Autopilot workspace** keeps the guided tour, preview training, guardrails, decisions, and completed-encode feedback together.
- **Continuous learning** lets you correct picture, playback, audio, subtitle, or size choices after watching a completed learned encode.
- **Decision history** shows why each item was eligible, skipped, or left waiting.
- **Optional AI advisor** supports local planning, Gemini Flash, OpenAI, or planner-only operation while the validated Size Wizard remains authoritative.
- **Production runtime** uses a single Gunicorn process with threaded HTTP handling so queue and scheduler ownership stays deterministic.

Autopilot is disabled and set to Observe by default. Its page now creates and displays the short accurate previews needed to train Smart Presets, with a visible review counter and no hidden prerequisite. See the [complete Autopilot guide](docs/AUTOPILOT.md).

## ByteSqueeze Mobile

ByteSqueeze is the Android-first Flutter companion for managing a TSD controller from a phone. It can browse movie and show posters, track shows, queue server-side Smart Preset jobs, manage active jobs, tune Autopilot, review learned preset decisions, and monitor workers, storage savings, and events. All transcoding remains on the Docker controller and its workers.

The mobile V3 Beta now mirrors the web workspace with an adaptive desktop
sidebar, polished phone navigation, a searchable command center, real Smart
comparison previews, full-season queues, mobile GPU-capacity controls, and a
persistent **Settings → Interface & layout → V2 Classic** fallback. Interface
density and V3/V2 selection are local to each device and never alter encoding
settings.

The same Flutter project includes an iOS target so networking, secure pairing, application state, responsive navigation, and screens can be carried into an iPhone release without a second implementation.

- Latest Android APK: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kevin1724/handbrake-tsd-helper/releases/latest)
- Pairing: open **Settings > Linked Nodes** and generate a one-time read or control code under Companion app access

LAN HTTP is supported for home-server use. Use a trusted HTTPS reverse proxy when connecting from outside the home network; do not expose the controller directly to the public internet.

## Why Use It

HandBrake is powerful, but managing a large library by hand is slow. This project adds a web UI, queue system, history, predictions, library scanning, and worker-node support around HandBrakeCLI.

Use it when you want to:

- Shrink large movies and shows
- Keep track of how much storage you saved
- Queue encodes from a browser
- Avoid re-encoding files that are already done
- Use presets without opening the HandBrake desktop app
- Send jobs to another machine on your network
- Keep original files safe unless an encode fully succeeds

## Quick Start

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevin1724/handbrake-tsd-helper.git
cd handbrake-tsd-helper
```

Edit `docker-compose.yml` and mount your media folders:

```yaml
services:
  hb-web:
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/movies:/media/Movies
      - /path/to/shows:/media/Shows
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./presets:/presets
```

Start the app:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open the web UI:

```text
http://SERVER-IP:8081
```

Recommended first setup:

1. Open Settings.
2. Select your CPU profile.
3. Confirm or upload your HandBrake presets.
4. Map movie and show folders.
5. Optionally add TMDb credentials for preferred artwork. Leave keyless artwork enabled so local sidecars, TVmaze, and Apple Search can fill any gaps without an API key.
6. Run a Library scan and track the shows you want in the release calendar.
7. Queue a few test encodes.
8. Open **Autopilot**, complete the guided preview training, and save the Safe starter or Balanced policy in Observe mode.

## Core Pages

### Home and Jobs

Home is the default page and is also available at `/dashboard`. It is a quiet overview of queue health, storage savings, library totals, workers, Autopilot readiness, and recent activity. Open `/jobs` for file and folder search plus queue operations.

- Browse folders and video files
- Select a file and encode it with presets
- Open a file in the Size Wizard
- Run batch tools
- View queued, running, completed, and failed jobs
- Track ETA, progress, estimated final size, saved size, and runtime
- Cancel running jobs
- View linked worker-node status

### Size Wizard

The Size Wizard helps choose better settings before starting an encode.

Simple Mode keeps the workflow easy:

- Pick a file
- Choose a quality goal
- Set a target size
- Choose speed or compression preference
- Keep or filter audio and subtitle languages
- Review the live plan
- Queue the encode

Advanced Mode keeps the full technical surface available:

- Codec and encoder
- AV1, HEVC, H.264, software, and QSV choices
- Bit depth
- Frame rate
- Resolution and downscale controls
- Audio tracks
- Subtitle tracks
- Language selection
- Crop, deinterlace, filters, two-pass, and extra args
- Saved wizard presets
- Fast and accurate previews

The wizard also includes an optional AI advisor. Open **Settings > AI & API Keys** to paste and test a Google Gemini or OpenAI key, or choose built-in local or planner-only operation. Cloud providers receive compact probe facts and selected options, never video or audio content. The deterministic planner continues to validate and own the final HandBrake plan. The complete [AI Advisor setup guide](docs/AI_ADVISOR.md) includes Gemini and OpenAI walkthroughs, Docker Compose examples, privacy details, sample questions, and troubleshooting.

Smart Presets add a learning loop on top of that safe planner:

- Choose the main goal, playback compatibility, hardware preference, and audio strategy
- Configure preservation-first protections in **Settings → Smart Presets**; they apply to movies, episodes, seasons, Autopilot, linked nodes, and ByteSqueeze
- Keep source resolution, black bars, and display aspect ratio so tight episode targets cannot silently become 720p
- Keep every audio and subtitle language, or select an explicit language list
- Require original audio passthrough, or opt into E-AC3 5.1 at 640 kbps when audio conversion is acceptable
- Generate three source-aware candidates ranked by quality, savings, speed, compatibility, and prior feedback
- Apply a candidate and inspect the same short HandBrake encode that a real job will use
- Approve the preview or mark quality, size, speed, or compatibility concerns
- Keep all preference history local in `data/smart_presets.json`
- Unlock automatic selection after the visible minimum of consistent reviews, currently two approvals for the default profile
- Keep learning after playback by rating completed learned jobs on the Autopilot page

The learned model is intentionally explainable. It uses similar source type, HDR state, resolution, codec, encoder family, target ratio, and output resolution to weight preview and post-encode reviews. The deterministic Size Wizard remains authoritative over HandBrake arguments, while the selected optional advisor helps evaluate and explain safe choices. When learning is ready, **Smart learned preset** is available from Jobs and Library, and Autopilot Manage mode can choose it automatically.

### Library

The Library page scans the movie and show folders you map in Settings.

- Cached scans
- Movie poster grid
- Show cards with seasons and episodes
- Artwork priority: TMDb when configured, then local `poster.jpg`/`folder.jpg`/`cover.jpg`, TVmaze show art, and Apple movie art
- Upcoming episode calendar for tracked and untracked library shows
- Complete title catalog plus recently added rails
- Sort by likely storage savings
- Filter by title, quality, type, and status
- Generate a real matched-frame and side-by-side Smart encode preview without leaving the Library
- Apply one-time Smart guardrails for resolution, compatibility, audio, subtitles, encoder, and size/detail balance
- Queue movies, episodes, seasons, shows, or selected batches
- Track show release dates and optionally auto-queue new episodes after their downloaded files become stable
- Send jobs to local encoding or linked workers

The scanner ignores files that already contain `-TSD`.

### Settings

Settings are split into cleaner sections:

- Encoding defaults
- Preset management
- CPU profile
- Intel QSV availability
- Optional local, Gemini Flash, OpenAI, or planner-only Size Wizard advisor
- Library folder mapping
- TMDb-first artwork when configured, with keyless artwork and episode-release metadata as the automatic fallback
- Auto scan
- Companion-app access and device revocation
- Linked nodes
- Events
- Storage savings

Events and storage savings use scrollable tables so the page stays compact.

## File Safety

The app is designed to protect original files.

- Failed jobs delete the incomplete `-TSD` output, not the source file
- Canceled jobs preserve the source file
- Already encoded `-TSD` files are skipped by scans and queues
- Remote-transfer output is verified before being written beside the original
- Original deletion only happens after a successful encode and verification
- Clear actions ask for confirmation

Keep backups of important media before enabling any aggressive cleanup behavior.

## Auto Scan

Auto scan can keep the Library updated without constantly probing every file.

By default, it is designed to run every 30 minutes. On each pass it:

1. Checks whether auto scan is enabled.
2. Skips if an encode is running and skip-while-encoding is enabled.
3. Loads the previous scan index.
4. Walks only mapped movie and show folders.
5. Compares path, size, and modified time.
6. Parses only new or changed video files.
7. Ignores `-TSD` files.
8. Marks missing files as removed.
9. Saves the scan index and Library cache.
10. Auto-queues tracked episodes only after file stability checks pass.

This keeps normal scans lightweight.

## Autopilot

Autopilot reuses the incremental Library index and existing file-safety checks. A decision cycle:

1. Scans only mapped media roots and ignores `-TSD` outputs.
2. Waits for new or changed files to pass the configured stability window.
3. Excludes files already owned by queued or running jobs.
4. Applies movie/show, minimum-size, and predicted-savings policy rules.
5. Sorts eligible work by predicted savings and source size.
6. In Observe mode, records recommendations only.
7. In Manage mode, waits until Smart Preset preview training is ready, then queues no more than the per-scan limit and never exceeds the active-job cap.

Autopilot does not weaken the existing output verification or original-file protections.

The dedicated web workspace provides a first-time tour, an explicit accurate-preview training panel, a visible review target, editable Safe starter/Balanced/Hands-off profiles, decision reasons, and optional feedback after a completed learned encode has actually been watched. Running a decision cycle does not silently start training. See [`docs/AUTOPILOT.md`](docs/AUTOPILOT.md) for the full workflow and troubleshooting guide.

## Headless Worker Encoding

The recommended worker is a separate, headless container. It has no media
browser, library scanner, settings website, or mapped media drives. The main
controller sends temporary jobs to the worker's `/work` drive and receives each
verified result when its encode finishes. Hardware workers can run multiple
encodes at the controller-managed limit; CPU/software work always runs alone.

- The main container owns the media library and queue
- Workers only expose authenticated node/health APIs
- The pairing code is printed in `docker logs`
- `/work` is the worker's only required mount
- Remote transfer is selected automatically; path mappings are unnecessary
- Pairing is idempotently recoverable for the same controller when a network response is lost
- Node state writes are serialized and atomic, with backup recovery
- Protocol discovery negotiates capabilities while remaining compatible with older workers
- Paired nodes use trusted tokens for commands
- Workers report heartbeat, status, progress, completed jobs, and errors
- Nodes can reconnect after normal offline periods
- Prediction history is tracked per worker
- Per-worker GPU capacity is configured only on the main node website

The controller can send jobs to the local node, the best available worker, or a selected worker.

See the versioned [Headless Worker Setup guide](docs/HEADLESS_WORKER.md) for
complete Linux, Unraid, and Windows work-drive mapping, pairing, multi-encode,
update, and troubleshooting instructions.

Use `GET /api/nodes/diagnostics` to inspect protocol, monitor health, heartbeat failures, and linked-node totals.

### Start and pair a worker

On the worker machine, copy `docker-compose.worker.yml`, choose the host folder
that should hold the current encode, and start it:

```bash
TSD_WORKER_WORK_DIR=/path/to/fast/transcode-drive docker compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml up -d
docker logs bytesqueeze-worker
```

The log contains a banner like:

```text
ByteSqueeze headless worker is ready
Pairing code:  ABCDE-FGHJK
```

On the main server, open **Settings → Linked Workers**, enter the worker URL
(for example `http://192.168.1.50:8082`) and that code, then select **Pair and
verify**. The controller records its reachable URL, negotiates the protocol,
forces remote-transfer mode, and immediately verifies the secure connection.

## ByteSqueeze Android Companion

ByteSqueeze ships from the shared Flutter project in `mobile/bytesqueeze`. The
phone is a remote control only; Docker controllers and workers perform every
encode.

- Discovery: `GET /api/mobile/v1/discovery`
- Pairing: `POST /api/mobile/v1/pair`
- Token rotation: `POST /api/mobile/v1/token/refresh`
- Read endpoints for status, jobs, nodes, events, library, release calendar, and Library preview progress
- Scoped queue, node-target, show-monitoring, and Autopilot controls
- Matched Library preview frames, per-season Smart Queue actions, and transient tuning from the phone
- Shared accurate-preview review and Smart Preset feedback from the phone
- Primary home address plus an optional Tailscale/away address with automatic connection failover
- Browser-admin controls for creating pairing codes and revoking devices

Access and refresh tokens are returned only to the client and stored on the server as hashes. Keep the web UI and mobile API on a trusted LAN or behind your own authenticated reverse proxy; the main web UI does not yet provide user accounts.

### Transfer lifecycle

1. The controller grants temporary authenticated file access.
2. The worker downloads the source file under `/work/jobs`.
3. The worker encodes locally.
4. The worker uploads the finished `-TSD` file back.
5. The controller verifies the output.
6. The controller writes the output beside the original file.
7. Temporary files are cleaned up.

If the controller is offline when the worker finishes, the worker keeps the finished output and waits to upload it later.

Full controller containers can still act as legacy mounted-media workers, but
that advanced mode is no longer required for the normal setup.

## Intel QSV / Quick Sync

The Docker image builds HandBrakeCLI with QSV support and installs Intel media runtime packages where available.

Rebuild after QSV-related Dockerfile changes:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache hb-web
docker compose up -d hb-web
```

Check QSV inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it hb-web check-qsv
```

Expected signs of working QSV:

```text
/dev/dri exists
vainfo returns Intel driver details
HandBrake lists qsv_h264, qsv_h265, or qsv_h265_10bit
```

Requirements:

- Intel CPU with enabled iGPU
- Host exposes `/dev/dri/renderD128`
- Compose maps `/dev/dri:/dev/dri`
- Container has access to `video` and `render` groups
- QSV render-device availability is enabled in Settings

Intel `F` and `KF` desktop CPUs usually do not include an iGPU.

### Concurrent hardware transcodes

**Settings → General → Encoding settings** controls the local node default.
**Settings → Linked Workers** adds a separate **Simultaneous hardware
transcodes** value for every paired worker. The safe default is `1`; `2` is a
practical starting point for modern Intel Quick Sync systems. Values up to `8`
are available for tested hardware. The limit applies to QSV, NVIDIA, AMD,
VideoToolbox, and VAAPI jobs. CPU/software encodes always run alone, and a queued
CPU job keeps its FIFO position instead of being bypassed by later GPU jobs.
Lowering the limit does not stop work already running; it only prevents another
job from starting until usage is below the new limit.

## Official Image

Pull:

```bash
docker pull kevina1724/handbrake-tsd-helper:latest
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name handbrake-tsd-helper \
  -p 8081:8080 \
  -v /path/to/media:/media/Media \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/data \
  -v /path/to/presets:/presets \
  --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
  kevina1724/handbrake-tsd-helper:latest
```

The `latest` image is published automatically from `main`. Version tags such as
`v1.2.3` also publish `1.2.3` and `1.2` tags.

The encoding-only worker has its own public Docker Hub image:

[kevina1724/handbrake-tsd-worker on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kevina1724/handbrake-tsd-worker)

`latest` follows the main branch. Versioned releases also publish tags such as
`2.3.0` and `2.3`:

```bash
docker pull kevina1724/handbrake-tsd-worker:latest
```

It needs one writable mount and no media mounts:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name bytesqueeze-worker \
  -p 8082:8080 \
  -e TSD_WORKER_NAME="Garage Worker" \
  -v /path/to/fast/transcode-drive:/work \
  kevina1724/handbrake-tsd-worker:latest

docker logs bytesqueeze-worker
```

## Runtime Data

Runtime state is stored in `data/`.

Common files:

```text
data/jobs.json
data/settings.json
data/storage_stats.json

```

Do not commit private runtime data, API keys, node secrets, cache files, or logs.

Safe staging example:

```bash
git add README.md Dockerfile docker-compose.yml .gitignore webui worker presets tests
git status --short
```

## Troubleshooting

### No files appear in Jobs

Check your Docker volume mounts. Media should be mounted under a path the app can browse, commonly `/media/...`.

### Library scan is empty

Open Settings and map at least one movie folder or show folder.

### Posters do not show

Refresh the Library after changing poster settings. ByteSqueeze prefers TMDb
when a key or read token is configured. Otherwise, or when no TMDb poster is
available, it uses `poster.jpg`, `folder.jpg`, or `cover.jpg` beside the media
before trying TVmaze/Apple.

### QSV does not show up

Run:

```bash
docker exec -it hb-web check-qsv
```

Confirm `/dev/dri` exists in the container and that the host iGPU is enabled.

### Worker pairing fails

Run `docker logs bytesqueeze-worker`, use the newest code, and confirm the URL
is reachable from the controller. Pairing codes are one-use and expire after an
hour. Restarting the worker prints a fresh code without deleting an existing
trusted controller.

### Worker cannot access a media path

The headless worker never accesses controller media paths. Confirm the worker
has enough free space in `/work` for the source and temporary output and that
the controller URL is reachable from the worker.

### Job looks stuck

Check the job progress, ETA, linked node status, and job log. If needed, cancel the job from the Jobs page.

Restart only when the process is truly stuck:

```bash
docker restart hb-web
```

## Updating

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

After larger UI updates, hard-refresh the browser.

## Roadmap

Current focus:

- Improve Size Wizard recommendations
- Polish Library workflows for shows, seasons, and episodes
- Expand hardware encoder support
- Build the Android companion client on top of the mobile API v1 contract
- Add web user authentication and per-user permissions
- Add notification hooks
