# Size Wizard AI Advisor

The AI Advisor is an optional explanation layer for Size Wizard. It can explain why a plan was chosen and translate plain-language goals into safe wizard-option suggestions. The deterministic Size Wizard still calculates, validates, previews, and queues the final HandBrake plan.

You can use:

- Google Gemini Flash
- OpenAI
- The bundled local advisor, when the image includes a usable local model
- Planner-only mode, with no language model

The normal Size Wizard advisor never sends video, audio, or subtitle content. The separate, explicitly opt-in **Beta per-episode scene analysis** feature sends only a few representative JPEG stills from each episode to the selected cloud provider; it never sends the full video or audio. API keys are never included in a prompt.

## Fastest setup: web interface

Open **Settings > AI & API Keys**, or go directly to:

```text
http://YOUR-TSD-SERVER:5000/settings/ai
```

Then:

1. Select Gemini or OpenAI.
2. Create an API key using the official link shown beside that provider.
3. Paste the key into the clearly labeled API-key box.
4. Keep the recommended model, or enter another supported model ID.
5. Click **Save & test selected provider**.
6. Wait for the success message, then click **Open Size Wizard**.

The API-key input becomes blank after saving on purpose. The green status pill says whether the key is stored and whether it came from Settings or an environment variable.

## Google Gemini setup

1. Open [Google AI Studio API keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Sign in and create or copy an API key.
3. In TSD, select **Google Gemini Flash**.
4. Paste the key into **Gemini API key**.
5. Use `gemini-3.6-flash`, the current recommended default, unless your Google account requires a different supported model.
6. Click **Save & test selected provider**.

Google documents API-key creation, restrictions, and server-side handling in its [Gemini API key guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key). Free-tier availability and quotas vary by model, account, and region; check the current [Gemini pricing and limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing).

## OpenAI setup

1. Open [OpenAI API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2. Create a new secret key and copy it. The full key is normally shown only once.
3. In TSD, select **OpenAI**.
4. Paste the key into **OpenAI API key**.
5. Keep `gpt-5.6-luna` for a cost-sensitive advisor, or choose another model supported by the Responses API.
6. Click **Save & test selected provider**.

See the official [OpenAI API quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) and [model catalog](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models). OpenAI API usage is separate from a ChatGPT subscription and may require API billing or credits.

## Docker Compose environment variables

The web form is the easiest option. For deployment-managed secrets, set one provider key as an environment variable. Environment variables override keys saved through Settings.

```yaml
services:
  handbrake-tsd-helper:
    image: kevina1724/handbrake-tsd-helper:latest
    environment:
      GEMINI_API_KEY: ${GEMINI_API_KEY}
      # Or use OpenAI instead:
      # OPENAI_API_KEY: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

Create a `.env` file beside `compose.yaml`:

```dotenv
GEMINI_API_KEY=replace-with-your-real-gemini-key
# OPENAI_API_KEY=replace-with-your-real-openai-key
```

Do not commit `.env` or paste a real key into screenshots, issues, logs, or chat. Recreate the container after changing its environment:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

Even when the key comes from an environment variable, open **Settings > AI & API Keys**, select the matching provider, and save the selection. The status pill will say `Key from environment`.

## Using the advisor in Size Wizard

1. Open a source from Jobs or Library, or select one in Size Wizard.
2. Choose your target size, quality goal, audio policy, and subtitle policy.
3. Wait for the plan to finish analyzing.
4. Use a suggested question or type your own in **Plan Assistant**.
5. Review any proposed changes and generate an accurate preview when visual quality matters.

Useful examples:

```text
Explain why this plan chose H.265.
```

```text
Prioritize quality but keep the result under 6 GB.
```

```text
Keep English and Spanish audio and subtitles.
```

```text
Keep surround sound; use E-AC3 5.1 only when passthrough is not possible.
```

```text
Keep the source at 4K and tell me how risky this target size is.
```

The advisor may suggest only supported Size Wizard fields. The normal planner recalculates the plan and remains authoritative.

## Beta per-episode Smart Presets

Open **Settings > Smart Presets** and enable **Beta: analyze every episode’s scene mix with the selected cloud AI**. This option requires OpenAI or Gemini to be selected and configured under **AI & API Keys**.

When a movie, season, or complete show is Smart Queued, ByteSqueeze now creates a separate immutable plan for every file. It probes that episode’s actual color transfer, primaries, bit depth, resolution, frame rate, duration, and codec. HDR/color decisions are never copied from another episode. Each plan also enforces a codec-aware minimum quality floor so a tight season target cannot starve a 4K HDR episode.

Smart Presets always lock the output to CFR at that file's own source-average frame rate. The same lock is re-applied when encoding begins, including on linked workers, so a mapped preset, AI adjustment, or node-specific encoder substitution cannot introduce scene-to-scene FPS changes.

With the beta option enabled, ByteSqueeze additionally:

- Samples 3–8 stills spread across that episode, avoiding the opening and ending where practical
- Sends low-detail JPEG copies plus technical probe facts to the configured cloud vision provider
- Receives a bounded profile for motion, grain, darkness, complexity, and animation/live-action content
- Applies at most a small target-size adjustment for that one episode
- Caches the result by a path/size/modified-time fingerprint; no sampled images are stored in the cache
- Falls back to deterministic per-episode planning on timeout, provider error, missing key, or frame-extraction failure

The cloud response cannot disable HDR metadata preservation, change resolution protection, remove audio/subtitles, select arbitrary HandBrake arguments, or bypass worker compatibility. Dynamic HDR formats also remain on a preservation-capable 10-bit encoder rather than being flattened merely to use an incompatible GPU path.

## What is sent to a cloud provider

For the normal Size Wizard chat advisor, only compact planning context is sent:

- Source filename, resolution, duration, size, HDR flag, and media type
- Selected goal, codec, encoder family, resolution, target size, audio mode, and subtitle mode
- A few planner decisions and warnings
- The question you type

The source filename is included to give the chat answer useful context. Media bytes, frames, audio samples, subtitle text, mapped-drive paths, raw HandBrake commands, and API keys are not put in the normal advisor prompt. Requests are made from the TSD server, not from the browser or phone.

The beta per-episode scene feature is the only exception for visual content: it sends the configured number of representative JPEG stills and technical facts, but omits the source filename and path from that vision prompt. It does not upload the video, audio, or subtitles. Leave the beta switch off if still images must never leave the server.

Keys saved through the UI are stored in the TSD data volume and masked in later API responses. Protect that volume and its backups like any other application secret. For stricter secret management, use Docker environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

### It says the provider needs setup

- Open **Settings > AI & API Keys**.
- Confirm the correct provider is selected.
- Paste the key, then click **Save & test selected provider**.
- If using Docker environment variables, recreate the container and look for `Key from environment`.

### The key box is empty after saving

That is expected. TSD never sends the saved secret back to the browser. Check the provider's status pill instead.

### HTTP 401 or invalid API key

Create a new key with the provider, paste it again, and save and test. Also check for an extra space or a revoked/restricted key.

### HTTP 429, quota, or billing error

The connection reached the provider, but that account has no available quota. Check the provider dashboard, model eligibility, current free-tier limits, or API billing.

### Model not found

Return to the recommended model shown in Settings, or copy a current compatible model ID from the provider's official model page. Model availability can differ by account and region.

### AI fails while building a plan

Encoding is not blocked. TSD falls back to its deterministic planner and marks the selected advisor as unavailable. Use **Save & test selected provider** to see the provider's direct error message.
